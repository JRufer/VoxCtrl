# VoxCtrl Documentation

VoxCtrl is a high-performance, privacy-first voice-to-text dictation application and programmable voice input broker. All processing happens 100% on-device with zero telemetry or cloud dependencies.

Global shortcuts are registered with your desktop through the XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal, so **VoxCtrl does not read your keyboard** and needs no permission setup at all. See [Privacy & Security](./privacy.md) for exactly what it can see and how to verify it.
